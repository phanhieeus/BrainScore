# Brain Score Project

A deep learning project for predicting future cognitive test scores from brain MRI images and demographics data.

## Overview

This project aims to predict four cognitive test scores (ADAS11, ADAS13, MMSCORE, CDGLOBAL) using:
- 3D brain MRI images
- Clinical data (gender, age, education)
- Time difference between MRI scan and cognitive test

The model combines these different types of data using a fusion architecture with:
- ResNet50 backbone for MRI feature extraction
- Clinical data encoder
- Time elapsed encoder
- Interaction layers to capture relationships between features

## Quick Start

For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Cognitive Tests

The model predicts scores from four cognitive tests:

1. ADAS11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - 11 items
   - Measures cognitive impairment
   - Higher scores indicate more severe impairment

2. ADAS13: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - 13 items
   - Extended version of ADAS11
   - Includes additional memory and language tasks

3. MMSCORE: Mini-Mental State Examination
   - Brief 30-point test
   - Assesses cognitive impairment
   - Lower scores indicate more severe impairment

4. CDGLOBAL: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale
   - Measures dementia severity
   - Higher scores indicate more severe dementia
